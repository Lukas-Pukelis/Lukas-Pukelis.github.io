## About me

Hey, I am Lukas Pukelis - glad you came by!

I am political scientist by education and a data scientist by trade. I have over 10 years of experience in data analysis and statistics and over 5 years experience with Python, Machine Learning and natural anguage processing. 

As a political scietist I work in Vilnius University exploring both classical political science themes: parliaments, governments and other institutions as well as what novel approaches (Big Data, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing) bring to the classical political science. 

As a data scientist, I lead a team of engineers and analists who have developed a data production platform, which collects raw data from diverse sources, integrates and transfroms it and provides analytics and insights. In that capacity, I have touched every aspect of the data production pipeline including:

* Web-scraping;
* Data warehousing;
* ETL;
* Process automation;
* Building ML models;
* Working with Cloud Infrastructures 

I am based in Vilnius, Lithuania.
