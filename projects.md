## Tracking of Research Results (H2020) (2018-2021):

During every 7-year budget cycle EU spends nearly €100 billion on research. While these projects are ongoing, they are closely monitored and evaluates, but what happens to them when they end? Do the ideas developed during the projects receive follow-up? Does the fundamental research get turned into more applied research and then to patents and innovations? Are the collaborations between different research institutions sustained after the project funding ends?

Previously, these questions were answered doing small-scale case studies, which were very labor intensive and could only provide insights for a small number of cases. This situation naturally prompted the question – can such studies be automated and insights generated for all the research projects rather than just a few? This is exactly what we did in the “Tracking of Research Results” project. 

The aim of this project was to integrate data from more than 20 public and proprietary sources and build a knowledge-graph, which would enable to track the impact of the research projects after they end. The knowledge-graph connects the EU project monitoring data, bibliometric records, intellectual property databases, company website data, major media outlets, and a number of sector specific databases (incl. clinical-trials, clinical-guidelines, and pharma products). The graph data structure is very flexible and can track the impact of research at project, institution and researcher level. 


## [OSDG (2020 - )](https://osdg.ai/)

The United Nations have identified 17 key goals we, as humanity, need to achieve by 2030 to make our future more sustainable. They include eliminating extreme poverty, ensuring access to food, clean water and education for populations around the world as well as combating the causes and mitigating the effects of climate change. They are called “Sustainable Development Goals”(SDGs) and they will help to focus and steer international development cooperation through 2030. 

While it is important that world governments do their part in achieving these goals, we all: individuals, institutions, and organizations can do our individual parts. However, for larger organizations identifying what SDG-relevant activities have been done already or identifying areas that could benefit from more attention can be daunting. Traditionally, this is done by organizing organization wide surveys and forcing people to fill out questionnaires. The effort required to communicate, organize and carry out such survey is astronomical and these resources can be better applied elsewhere. 

To this end, we have built OSDG. An open and free web-app which allows individuals and organizations to scan their documents and identify which of their activities are SDG-relevant and to which SDGs they have contributed.  


## [BIGPROD 2019-2021](https://www.bigprod.eu/)

Our understanding how the economy works is in part shaped by large scale models, which use data to simulate the behavior of individual agents (firms or households), which in turn allow us to make educated guesses how various changes (e.g. in tax or interest rates, household or government spending) will impact the economy. The data here plays a critical role – better data means better models. Better models mean better understanding how the economy functions. However, these models have suffered from the general lack of quality data. Most of the firm level models rely on enterprise surveys as a data source and are limited to the variables in the survey dataset. The aim of this project is to improve the situation by creating new, much needed datasets from company websites. 

During the project we scraped over 200 thousand company websites and then used NLP and text-mining to produce new indicators for macro-economic models. The indicators include measures for: the  service orientation of the company, the level of digitalization in the company and level of AI uptake in the company.    


## [Lithuanian National Electoral Study](http://www.lnes.tspmi.vu.lt/) 

The aim of the Lithuanian National Political study is to organize a survey after each major election to gain better insights into how and why people vote. The current iteration of the study also features a work-package on populism. With the team from Vilnius University, we have build a text-classier which can recognize populist content in text. With this tool we perform a large scale classification of electoral manifestos and media articles authored by politicians. The results indicate that peak populism levels were reached during 2009 financial crisis and have since decreased, making Lithuania one of the very few countries in the region unaffected by the rise of populism.
